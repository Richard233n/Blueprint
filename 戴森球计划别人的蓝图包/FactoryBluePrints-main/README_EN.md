## Introduction

This is the blueprint repository in the game [**Dyson Sphere Program**](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1366540/_/), used to store and share Factory blueprints from the community  

The first batch of blueprints were mainly contributed by members of **小马蓝图群** and **Cosmical Institute of Design and Technology**. In order to classify, manage, store and share a large number of blueprints from the community, we plan to upload the blueprints to github as a backup of the QQ group files, and may further build a blueprint network in the future.  

You can join the QQ group and upload the blueprint to the group file. We will classify and upload the blueprint in the group file to the blueprint repository from time to time. If there is any omission, you can remind us in the QQ group. You can also submit directly in the form of pull request, please submit to the most appropriate folder according to the blueprint function.  

Except for github, you can contact us in these ways: (QQ Group)
